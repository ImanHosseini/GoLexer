# GoLexer
A lexer using Go
It was done as course assignment for compiler design. I tried Go, to get to know Go better. Thanks for Rob Pike for his talk on why Go is a natural chocice for Jackson Structured Programming and lexers. </br>
Processing the input and then emitting tokens and processing them, naturally fits into a producer-consumer pattern and it is realized here, with two goroutines.
